- (object) {type: The type of the color rules.} - The color rules.
    - "random" - The spheres will be chosen randomly from a given color list. The frequency of color changes can be changed.
        - colors (array) - A list of integers. These are the colors that will be assigned to the newly created Spheres on the path.
            - (integer) - A single sphere color.
        - colorStreak (number) [>=0,<=1] - The probability of the next color being the same as the previous one in sequence.
        - forceDifferentColor* (boolean) - If set, two like-colored clumps cannot have the same color if next to each other. This reduces likelihood of apparent big clumps of a single color.
    - "pattern" - The sphere order will be chosen from a predefined list. The list will wrap around.
        - pattern (array) - A list of integers. Colors will be drawn in order from this list and will wrap around.
            - (integer) - A single sphere color.
